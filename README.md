# Blockchain-Development
About the Project The Smart Grid Guardians is a gamified energy management platform designed to promote sustainable energy consumption through incentives, AI-based predictions, and blockchain-powered smart contracts. The goal of the project is to empower individuals, businesses, and communities to optimize their energy usage while contributing to the stability of the power grid.

Inspired by the growing demand for smarter cities and energy solutions, we wanted to create a platform that not only helps users manage their energy usage but also makes it engaging through rewards. Our mission is to foster collaboration between users and grid operators, ensuring a sustainable and resilient energy future.

# Tech Stack

Blockchain: Ethereum

Smart Contract Language: Solidity (v0.8.0+)

Tools:

Remix IDE

Truffle

Web3.js

# Getting Started

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js

npm 

Truffle or Hardhat 

# Deployment

Using Remix

Open Remix IDE.

Upload the .sol file to the Remix file explorer.

Compile the smart contract using the correct Solidity version.

Deploy the contract on the desired network (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Testnets like Goerli, or a local Ganache instance).

# Using Hardhat or Truffle

Update the configuration file (hardhat.config.js or truffle-config.js) with your network details.

Deploy the contract:

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>

# Usage

Interacting with the Contract:

Use the deployed contract address to interact with the smart contract using:

Remix

Web3.js or Ethers.js (via a frontend)

A blockchain explorer like Etherscan.
